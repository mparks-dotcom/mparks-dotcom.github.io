        As a transfer New Media and Digital Design student at Fordham University, it is my hope to explore the intersection between technology and storytelling. 
        I am deeply interested in learning how technology can be used to build online environments that compel viewers both emotionally and intellectually and keep them coming back. 
        This year, it is my goal to get more exposure and be immersed in this field and learn more about coding and computer science and how those tools can support the world of marketing and communication.
        My creative journey has taken me a lot of places—journalism, videography, photography, graphic design, and now… here. 
        Here, you will find a portfolio and collection of work from Fall 2024.
